# Geofencing

When a user joins a channel, <Vg k="VSDK" /> automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" />. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. Agora geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" /> by specifying the <Vg k="AGORA_BACKEND" /> region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for geofencing:

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented xref:{rootdir}/get-started/get-started.adoc[Get started with <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/>].

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />,  open the xref:{rootdir}/get-started/get-started.adoc[Get started with <Vpd k="PRODUCT"/>] project you created previously.

== Implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />

This section shows how to use the <Vg k="VSDK" /> to implement geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented geofencing in your <Vpl k="CLIENT" />:

. [Generate a temporary token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/get_appid_token?platform=All#generate-a-temporary-token)  in <Vpl k="CONSOLE" />.

. In your browser, navigate to the <Vg k="DEMO_PAGE_LINK" /> and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _JOIN_.
