# Geofencing

When a user joins a channel, {data.VSDK} automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of {data.AGORA_BACKEND}. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. Agora geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your {props.CLIENT} by specifying the {data.AGORA_BACKEND} region users connect to.

## Understand the tech

This section shows you how to enable geofencing in your {props.CLIENT}. The following figure shows the workflow you implement for geofencing:

![Netowrk geofencing](/images/others/geofencing.svg)

## Prerequisites

In order to follow this procedure you must have implemented [Get started with {props.PRODUCT}](../video-sdk/get-started/get-started).

## Project setup

In order to create the environment necessary to implement geofencing in your {props.CLIENT},  open the [Get started with {props.PRODUCT}](../get-started/get-started.adoc) project you created previously.

## Implement geofencing in your {props.CLIENT}

This section shows how to use the {data.VSDK} to implement geofencing in your {props.CLIENT}.

<ProjectImplement />

## Test your implementation

To ensure that you have implemented geofencing in your {props.CLIENT}:

- {data.TOKEN-GENERATE-LINK} in {data.CONSOLE}.

- In your browser, navigate to the {data.DEMO-PAGE-LINK} and update _App ID_, _Channel_, and _Token_ with the values for your temporary token, then click _JOIN_.
